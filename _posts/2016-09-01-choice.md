Who loves the world?  
Are they the lucky ones?  

Was it a choice--  
and who made it?  

The Sun plays no favorites  
The birds sing for everyone  
The wind and the trees dance  

just because.  

Day after day  
the Earth crumbles  
and is born again  

Focus is a choice  
Kindness is a choice  
Love is a choice  

Luck is just one question  
in life's fiery mystery.
