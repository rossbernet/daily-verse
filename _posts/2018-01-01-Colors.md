I see
so vividly
a new red

only a moment old.

Born as the sun
dips below the horizon.

But this feeling --
I've felt this before.

These reds, oranges, yellows

are the same fire
lighting the ends of branches

as summer gives way to
autumun's spectacle of color.

a feast of light for the trees
to breath
a last gasp

as the suns fire cools
and the trees prepare to wait
for winters grip to slip

awakening again
in a spring sunrise
