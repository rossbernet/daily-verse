Swirling
steaming
meant for sipping
acidic
sweet
complete.

A taste of tropics
rich as chocolate
it is my morning treat

when I can
I sip it down
I like to drink it slow
the sounds
the motion
make for me
a ritualistic flow

addiction maybe
caffeine crazy
no need to test my luck

but a day
is not a day
without my morning cup
